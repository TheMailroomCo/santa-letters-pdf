<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>

<p>For <span class="personalized-text">{numberOfChristmases}</span> Christmases, I have watched over you knowing this day would come. The day I can share something extraordinary with you. And today, I want to let you in on that secret.</p>

<p>I've watched you grow into someone who is <span class="personalized-text">{characteristics}</span>, and now, I know you're ready. You see <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, the truth is, I don't do it all on my own. The magic of Christmas is so big and powerful that even I need help to keep it alive. Only a special few are entrusted with this secret, and I'd love you to help me.</p>

<p>This is a very important role. Your parents took on this responsibility when they were your age, and they've been helping me keep the magic alive for your family ever since. The best part? Now it's your turn. Your job is to carry the magic of Christmas in your heart and always share kindness with those around you. Many still believe, and now, they'll look to you to keep the magic going.</p>

<p>So, I officially ask you, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, to join me, and become a Santa Claus. It's a big responsibility, but I know you're ready. This Christmas, your first task is to <span class="personalized-text">{actOfKindness}</span>. And remember, Christmas isn't just about what we receive, but what we give.</p>

<p>My proudest moment yet is welcoming you into this extraordinary tradition, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. This is where your journey as a Santa Claus begins.</p>

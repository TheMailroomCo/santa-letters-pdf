<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>

<p>As I was making my way to <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>, I found myself thinking about the night sky. There's something about the stars that I've never told you before. The oldest, wisest elves often share tales of the stars and their magical glow. And do you know what makes those stars twinkle so brightly? It's you, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>.</p>

<p>Each time you show kindness, like when you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>, the stars above glow a little brighter, helping me find my way to you at Christmas time. The elves often gather around the fire, sharing tales of children just like you, whose light shines so brightly it reaches all the way to the North Pole.</p>

<p>But there's something especially magical about you, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. Your kindness is so special that it doesn't just light up the night sky, it also lights up the hearts of everyone around you, bringing warmth and happiness wherever you go. When you help a friend, share a smile, or show kindness in big or small ways, it's like sending a little bit of Christmas magic up into the sky.</p>

<p>So, the next time you look up at the night sky, remember that those shining stars reflect all the kindness in the world, and you're a special part of that magic. Keep making the elves and me proud, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span> and know that every act of kindness makes the world a brighter place.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

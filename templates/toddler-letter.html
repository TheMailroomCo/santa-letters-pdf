<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>
<p>How excited I am to be writing to you for your <span class="personalized-text">{numberOfChristmases}</span> Christmas! Here at the North Pole, we spend all year preparing for one special night. The elves, my oldest and wisest friends who help me watch over children just like you, spend their days keeping track of every wonderful thing that happens in the world. My reindeer practice their magic, getting stronger for the long journey ahead. All of this, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, is for Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>You see, on Christmas Eve, the impossible becomes possible. Reindeer who spend all year with their hooves on the ground suddenly soar through the night sky. I travel the entire world between sunset and sunrise. My sleigh, carrying everyone's wishes, becomes light as a feather as it flies from the North Pole to <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>. This is what people call Christmas magic. But the truth is, magic doesn't just wait for Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>I've been watching over you all year long. Watching you grow and learn and discover. I saw when you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. That was magic happening. Not the Christmas Eve kind with flying reindeer, but something even better. The kind of magic that happens when someone learns something new. The kind that makes everyone around you proud. That's your magic, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>.</p>
<p>You're still so small, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, but look at everything you can already do! You never give up. You try again and again until you get it right. That determination, that brave little spirit, that's your real magic. And as you grow bigger and stronger and learn even more wonderful things, hold onto that magic. All you have to do is believe. Just like I believe in you.</p>

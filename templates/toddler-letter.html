<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>
<p>What a joy it is to write to you again for your <span class="personalized-text">{numberOfChristmases}</span> Christmas! When I was looking through my list of all the wonderful children, there was your name, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, glowing even brighter than last year. The elves gathered around to see, and we all smiled because we know what that means. You're learning new things and discovering more of the world every single day, and that makes your light shine stronger.</p>
<p>This year, you have been quite remarkable to watch. I saw when you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. Oh, how proud we all are! The elves have been cheering for you all year long. You see, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, every time you learn something new, or try something that seemed impossible before, it sends the most wonderful sparkle all the way from <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span> to us here at the North Pole. That's how we know Christmas magic is working all year round.</p>
<p>Do you remember what the most important thing about magic is? That all you have to do is believe in it. And, you've been doing exactly that without even knowing it. Every time you reach for something just out of your grasp, every time you try to say a new word, every time you take another step into this big, beautiful world - that's believing, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. That's the magic I was talking about.</p>
<p>You're growing so fast, and look how much you've learned since your very first Christmas! Keep discovering, keep exploring and keep being amazed by all the beautiful things around you. The world has so many more wonderful things to show you, and I'll be watching every magical moment.</p>

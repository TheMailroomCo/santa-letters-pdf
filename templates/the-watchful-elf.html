<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>

<p>I have been looking forward to writing this letter to you for some time <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. I've seen how kind you have been this year, always bringing happiness to those around you. Your kindness has not gone unnoticed. It shines so brightly, even here at the North Pole.</p>

<p>But did you know it is not just me who has been watching over you? There's a special little elf in my workshop named Ember, who thinks you're truly amazing. Ember is a shy little elf, with red hair and rosy cheeks, and <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, you have become very special to them.</p>

<p>Ember told me how you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span> and how you show kindness in ways big and small. Every time you do, the stars above the North Pole twinkle a little brighter, helping me find my way to you on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Ember really wanted to deliver this letter to you tonight. They have never been to <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>, but no matter how much the reindeer reassured them, Ember is still afraid of flying. Remember, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, the real magic of Christmas is in believing. Believing in magic. Ember and I are so proud of you. Not just for what you have achieved, but for the kind and thoughtful person you are. Keep believing in that magic and it will shine through you all year long, lighting up the lives of those around you.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

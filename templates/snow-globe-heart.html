<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>
<p>At the North Pole, I have learned many secrets about magic. But the most beautiful secret of all is about a very special kind of heart. Some children are born with hearts that hold entire magical worlds inside them, just like a snow globe, each one different and wonderful.</p>
<p>These hearts are never still. Sometimes they beat gently, and all the feelings inside settle peacefully like soft snowflakes. Other times they beat faster with big emotions, and everything swirls and dances with such intensity. When you shake a snow globe, everything moves at once - that's exactly how some hearts work, feeling everything all at the same time.</p>
<p>In <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>, I know a child with a heart exactly like this. A child whose feelings are bigger and deeper than most people's. Someone who showed incredible strength when you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. You handled your big feelings with such grace, proving just how powerful your heart truly is. You, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, have what we call at the North Pole... a snow globe heart.</p>
<p><span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, your snow globe heart means you feel everything more - the happy moments sparkle brighter, the sad moments feel deeper, and sometimes all those feelings swirl together like sparkles dancing in the light. Your snow globe heart helps you love bigger, care deeper, and understand what others are feeling in ways that most people can't. The world truly needs hearts like yours, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. You are exactly what makes it magical.</p>
<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

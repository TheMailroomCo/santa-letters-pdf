<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>,</p>

<p>My favourite Christmas treasure is a snow globe. It holds an entire magical world inside, and did you know, some children carry that same kind of magic in their hearts? In <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>, I know one of these precious children. Your heart, <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>, holds more feelings than most people even know exist. You have what we call at the North Pole... a snow globe heart.</p>

<p>Do you know who else has a heart like yours? Bramble, our littlest elf. Their feelings are bigger than their small body can hold. Happiness makes them laugh until they cry. Worry keeps them awake. Even beautiful things, like fresh snow on the workshop roof, can make them so happy it hurts. The other elves used to worry when Bramble needed breaks, when everything became too much. But we've learned something precious: Bramble's big feelings help them understand what others need. All those big emotions that sometimes become too much are exactly what helps them pour magic into everything around them.</p>

<p>Just like you, <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>. When your emotions feel huge and overwhelming, when you care so deeply, that's your superpower. I saw this when <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. Your big feelings help you understand others and love with your whole heart.</p>

<p>The world needs people like you and Bramble - the ones who feel deeply enough to make it softer and kinder for everyone else. Your snow globe heart isn't too much. It's exactly what the world needs.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>

<p>Once upon a time, on a quiet Christmas Eve just like this one, a heartfelt wish was made and sent to the North Pole. Your <span class="personalized-text">{parentsNames}</span> wrote a letter to me, Santa Claus. Their letter wasn't filled with lists of toys or games but with a single, precious wish. They wished for something so extraordinary, so wonderful, that it could change their world forever.</p>

<p>You see, wishes like these don't come around often. They are the kind that fill the North Pole with a special sense of excitement. However, it wasn't a wish that could be granted overnight. This kind of miracle needed time, patience, and a little bit of magic. Then, at just the right moment, when the stars aligned and the world was ready, their wish came true. That miracle, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, was you.</p>

<p>Tonight is particularly special because I get to share the magic of Christmas with you for the very first time. Christmas is a time when the world comes alive with wonder and joy. It's a season filled with twinkling lights, festive songs, and the warmth of being with loved ones. But the most wonderful part of Christmas is believing. Believing in magic and wishes. The same kind that brought you into the world.</p>

<p>As you grow, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, you will discover that the simplest acts of kindness are the most special. A warm hug, a gentle word, or a helping hand. These are the true treasures of life, the real magic that we can share with others and exactly what Christmas is all about. Always believe in this magic, little <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, for it lives in your heart and will shine through you every day if you just believe.</p>

<p>And one day, when you're ready, I hope you too will write me a letter, filled with your own wishes and dreams. Until then, know that I am always watching over you, and you were wished for and dreamed of. A wish like no other.</p>

<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>,</p>

<p>Every year when the first snow falls, we gather for The Royal Winter Gala. It is our most treasured tradition at the North Pole. During this special evening, the elves recognise children whose achievements have inspired us across the world.</p>

<p>This year, something wonderful happened. Bramble, our littlest elf, stepped forward for the very first time. In the grand ballroom, with all eyes upon him, Bramble began to tell us about an extraordinary child in <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>. A child who works hard at everything they do and never gives up when things get difficult.</p>

<p>Bramble spoke of how this child had recently accomplished something truly special. He described their dedication, their perseverance, and the joy they brought to everyone around them. The whole hall leaned in closer, waiting to hear which special child had earned this recognition.</p>

<p>Then Bramble lifted a golden card high above his head. With the biggest smile, he announced your name: <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>. He shared your incredible story of how you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. The room erupted with applause and cheers, and everyone could see why your accomplishment was so special that it deserved to be celebrated.</p>

<p>So <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>, I just had to write to you and let you know that your name was announced with pride at The Royal Winter Gala. Bramble's story about you will be told for years to come, because you've proven something we hold dear at the North Pole: when you believe in magic and in yourself, extraordinary things happen.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

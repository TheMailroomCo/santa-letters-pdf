<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>,</p>

<p>At the centre of the North Pole stands the Grand Library of Kind Hearts, where our wisest elves maintain the most precious collection of books in existence. These are not ordinary books. Each golden volume holds stories of children the elves have noticed choosing kindness when it really mattered.</p>

<p>This year, the elves approached me with such excitement. A new story had arrived from <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>, one so remarkable it deserved its own special place on the highest shelf. It was about a child who always thinks of others and who notices when someone needs help. That remarkable child was you, <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>.</p>

<p>The elves carefully wrote your name onto the cover, remembering when you <span class="personalized-text">{actOfKindness}</span>. That was the exact moment they knew your story belonged here. And when your book was placed on the shelf, our collection was complete.</p>

<p><span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>, your story now lives forever in the Grand Library of Kind Hearts. And every time someone needs reminding that kindness still exists in the world, the elves open your book and read your story aloud.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

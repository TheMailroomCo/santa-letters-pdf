<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>,</p>

<p>There's something truly magical that I want to share with you. You see, every time something wonderful and unexpected happens, something that makes your heart skip a beat, real magic is at work. This magic is all around us, especially at Christmas, and it's made even stronger by those who believe in it.</p>

<p>I can see the magic that shines within you, <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>. When you believe in magic, it comes out of you like stardust, brightening everything around you. What I find most magical about you is the way you <span class="personalized-text">{achievement}</span>. You bring light and joy to everyone you meet.</p>

<p>Christmas is the most magical time of the year, when the world is filled with wonder and joy. It's the perfect time to believe in magic because it's when the magic is strongest. When I arrived at <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span> to deliver this letter, I found my way because of your belief. Your magic guided me here, lighting the way just like the stars in the night sky.</p>

<p>So, the next time you feel something magical, remember that it's your belief that makes it real. Keep that magic alive in your heart, <span class="personalized-text">{name}</span>, because every time you believe, you help make the world a more magical place.</p>

<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{childrenNamesInLetter}</span>,</p>

<p>I have seen many wonders in my time. Snow falling in the quiet corners of the world, stars that burn for thousands of years. But in all my travels, I've discovered something even more magical, a truth about families that most people don't learn until they're much older, right here in <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span>. Let me share the magic with you.</p>

<p>You are each other's first friends. Before you knew anyone else in this wide world, you knew each other. You learned to laugh at the same jokes, to create games only you understand, to find joy in simply being together. No one else will ever know the secret language you share.</p>

<p>You are each other's fiercest protectors. I see it in the quiet ways. Like how <span class="personalized-text">{actOfKindness}</span>. You guard each other's hearts without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>And perhaps the most beautiful of all: you are each other's forever home. I saw this clearly when <span class="personalized-text">{familyAchievements}</span>. Long after childhood ends, when the world feels too big or too hard, you'll still have each other, the ones who know your whole story, where you'll always belong because together, you are the <span class="personalized-text">{familyLastName}</span> family.</p>

<p>So remember, <span class="personalized-text">{childrenNamesInLetter}</span>, even when miles or years stretch between you, this remains true: There is no greater Christmas gift than having each other. You are each other's beginning, middle, and end. You are each other's always.</p>

<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>

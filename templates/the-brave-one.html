<p>My dearest <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>,</p>
<p>I've been thinking about you as I prepare for Christmas. In all my travels around the world, I meet many children who show courage in different ways. But something happened this year involving a special child from <span class="personalized-text">{location}</span> that made everyone at the North Pole stop and take notice.</p>
<p>Word spread quickly about how you faced something that felt truly scary, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>. How you took a deep breath, felt your heart pounding, but chose to be brave anyway. The moment when you <span class="personalized-text">{braveMoment}</span>. I saw the quiet strength in your heart as you chose to be brave.</p>
<p>Do you know what happened at the North Pole in that moment? Everything stopped. The elves put down their hammers. The reindeer pressed their noses against the frosted windows to watch. Because we all recognised what we were seeing: pure, unstoppable bravery.</p>
<p>The reindeer have a special name for you now. They call you "The Brave One." Not because things are easy for you, but because when things are hard, you find the strength to do them anyway.</p>
<p>That's why you're such an inspiration to us here at the North Pole, <span class="personalized-text">{letterName}</span>, and when the elves ask me about heroes, I don't tell them stories from long ago. I tell them about you.</p>
<p>With all my love and Christmas magic,</p>
